                <p1 style="color: black; text-align: left; font-size: larger; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Living things of fantasy and science fiction are admittedly more interesting than their mundane counterparts. Most people find a dragon more interesting than a lizard, and a unicorn more interesting than a horse. What people fail to consider is that the best imaginary creatures are grounded in the anatomy of real creatures. Irregardless of my personal bias for both designs, the reason Weta Workshop's design for Smaug was better received than the 70s Rankin-Bass animated incarnation is simple: it was more grounded. A serpentine mix of the worst traits of snake, Komodo dragon, Pterosaur, bat, and Theropod dinosaur was a bit easier for audiences to swallow as capable of flight despite his Godzilla-like size. The Rankin-Bass Smaug, however endearing I may find him, has a design that charitably can be compared to a boar/cat/bat/Apatosaurus hybrid, and more often I have seen compared to "Snarf from Thundercats after steroids". With that in mind, I do my best to account for the actual biomechanics behind how a fantastic or alien creature would act and live its daily life. Fiery breath and telepathy have to come from somewhere, and I believe that source should be an organ.</p1>
